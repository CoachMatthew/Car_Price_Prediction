# Project Title: Predicting Car Prices: An Exploration of Key Factors

This data analysis project aims to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates car prices based on various factors. The project explores the relationships between car prices and attributes such as make, model, year, mileage, engine size, and transmission type. 

<h2> Objectives: </h2>

* Identify the most significant factors influencing car prices.
* Develop a predictive model using machine learning algorithms.
* Evaluate the performance of the model.
* Visualize the relationships between car prices and key factors.

### Methodology:
* Data importation
* Analyzing individual feature pattern using visualization
* Descriptive statistical analysis
* Basics of group

### Tools and Technologies:
- Python programming language.
- Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib libraries for data analysis and visualization.
- Scikit-learn library for machine learning.
- Jupyter Notebook on VS code for project development.

### Dataset:
A dataset of car listings with attributes such as:
- Make
- Model
- Year
- Mileage
- Engine size
- Transmission type
- Price
