# Predicting Car Prices: An Exploration of Key Factors
This data analysis project aims to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates car prices based on various factors. The project explores the relationships between car prices and attributes such as make, model, year, mileage, engine size, and transmission type.
Objectives:
1. Identify the most significant factors influencing car prices.
2. Develop a predictive model using machine learning algorithms.
3. Evaluate the performance of the model.
4. Visualize the relationships between car prices and key factors.
Methodology:
1. Data importation
2. Analyzing individual feature pattern using visualization
3. Descriptive statistical analysis
4. Basics of group
